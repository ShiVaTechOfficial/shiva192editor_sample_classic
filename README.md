# ShiVa 192 Editor - Classic Samples
This repo contains a collection of classic ShiVa 1.9.2 demos that came pre-installed with the editor. The samples are so simple and easy to understand that they serve as ShiVa introduction and learn-by-example tutorials alike. Samples that were either too big (e.g. TheHUNT) or were incompatible with ShiVa 2.0 without modification (e.g. plugin projects) are not included.
